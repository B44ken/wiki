See [Eric's presentation][2] on behalf of CSS for landing internships. It covers a bit of everything,
from resumes to applying and nailing your interview.

For co-op, job listings are located on the [central co-op portal][3]. For internships, you have to find listings
on your own. Some good places to search:

-   [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/). LinkedIn isn't just a social platform for bugging recruiters!
    It has an integrated job board with _tons_ of internships.
-   [Intern Supply](https://intern.supply), though the links are usually broken. It can serve as a master list of
    fantastic companies that offer internships.
-   [Work In Tech](https://www1.communitech.ca/jobs) has an extensive list of job opportunities, though most of
    them are not internships.
