## Working in the US

Almost every major tech company in the US hires Canadians and will sponsor you for a visa. US companies tend to pay
_significantly_ more and offer great opportunities.

### Visa

You'll need a **J-1** visa to intern in the US. A common misconception is that you can get a visa yourself - this is
not true. You need a company who is willing to sponsor your visa to work in the United States. Once you find this company
they will do most of the work for you, you'll just have to submit some documents/forms. Don't stress about this step.

### Getting Paid

You'll need an American bank account to get paid if you're working in the US. This is very easy to obtain - just go to your
preferred bank once you're in the US and bring your passport and visa documents just in case.

It's also a very good idea to obtain a Social Security Number in the US so that you can apply for a credit card and build up
a credit score in the US (can be helpful in many ways in the future). This is also straight-forward, but you need to wait
until you're in the US for at least 10 days before you can apply.
