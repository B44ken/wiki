#### Can I do an internship/co-op during my first year?

The co-op program does not start until the summer of your 2nd year; however, you can apply to internships on your
own in 1st year. You should try to apply to places in 1st year, you have nothing to lose!

#### What is the difference between a co-op and internship?

Co-op and internship jobs are usually very similar. They're both short-term jobs. Co-ops are usually landed
through the co-op program, whereas for internships you apply to them like a normal job (i.e. find postings online
and apply). See [here](choosing) for more details.

#### Should I pay for co-op or just go for internships?

Do both! Apply for internships and use co-op as a fallback. Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's
significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program.

#### Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program?

Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you
from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program,
co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening.
