## Creating a Resume

Recruiters spend, on average, between 6 and 10 seconds looking at your resume. Its important that your resume makes a
strong first impression and demonstrates why you're a strong candidate for the position. Your resume should be at most
one page, cover your past experience, technical skills, projects, relevant education, and soft skills. Do not include
your secondary school education - if you've made it to University, you probably did well in secondary school.
