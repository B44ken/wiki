#### _Warning_

Co-op has been known to decline offers for winter internships for students that haven't completed their co-op course
training. If you wish to have a winter internship before you have completed your co-op training course, make sure it
is one which does not go through co-op.

## FAQ

#### Q: Can I do an internship/co-op during my first year?

A: The co-op program does not start until the summer of your 2nd year; however, you can apply to internships on your
own in 1st year. You should try to apply to places in 1st year, you have nothing to lose!

#### Q: What is the difference between a co-op and internship?

A: Co-op and internship jobs are usually very similar. They're both short-term jobs. Co-ops are usually landed
through the co-op program, whereas for internships you apply to them like a normal job (i.e. find postings online
and apply). Here's a more specific breakdown:

#### Q: Should I pay for co-op or just go for internships?

Do both! Apply for internships and use co-op as a fallback. Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's
significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program.

#### Q: Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program?

A: Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you
from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program,
co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening.

#### Q: Do grades matter?

A: For most co-op applications you must submit your transcript. Smaller/local companies may look at grades. However,
for internships, you will not need to submit your transcript for 99% of applications.

## Co-op Versus Internships

|            | Pros                                                      | Cons                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Co-op      | More opportunities, especially for international students | $500 every semester even if you are not working. Some students believe that Co-op is not specialized in advising computer science students, leading to worse resumes |
| Internship | Free to apply                                             | It can be hard to get your foot in the door                                                                                                                          |

## Finding a Job

See [Eric's presentation][2] on behalf of CSS for landing internship. It covers a bit of everything,
from resumes to applying and nailing your interview.

For co-op, job listings are located on the [central co-op portal][3]. For internships, you have to find listings
on your own. Some good places to search:

- [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/). LinkedIn isn't just a social platform for bugging recruiters!
  It has an integrated job board with _tons_ of internships.
- [Intern Supply](https://intern.supply), though the links are usually broken. It can serve as a master list of
  fantastic companies that offer internships.
- [Work In Tech](https://www1.communitech.ca/jobs) has an extensive list of job opportunities, though most of
  them are not internships.

## Creating a Resume

Recruiters spend, on average, between 6 and 10 seconds looking at your resume. Its important that your resume makes a
strong first impression and demonstrates why you're a strong candidate for the position. Your resume should be at most
one page, cover your past experience, technical skills, projects, relevant education, and soft skills. Do not include
your secondary school education - if you've made it to University, you probably did well in secondary school.

### Perfecting your Resume

- [This article](https://www.gautamtata.com/blog/get-a-job-1) on resume design explains how to optimize your resume to
  improve your chances of being interviewed.
- [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co) can help you optimize your resume to give you the best chance to get past the robots
  and get seen by a real recruiter.

## Interview Preparation

Eric recommends studying and practicing technical interview questions for any mid-to-large-sized company. Most of
them will ask you highly technical coding questions.

### Interview Prep Resources

- [LeetCode][4] - Eric highly recommends LeetCode and has used it for all of his interview prep. It has hundreds of
  questions with difficulty ratings and company-specific questions submitted by interviewees. Most internships will
  ask LeetCode easy or medium questions.
- [LeetFree][5] - This website contains all LeetCode Premium problems for free.
- [Cracking the Coding Interview][6] - Eric highly recommends reading this book before getting into LeetCode for
  interview prep. You can find it on [Amazon][7] or as [a PDF online][6].
- [Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions][8] - Online solutions for the problems in Cracking the Coding Interview.
  Harshdip recommends to try all the problems on your own and only looking for solutions once you have tried everything
  you know.
- [HackerRank][9] - Brandon highly recommends getting familiar with the HackerRank editor and available languages.
  Many companies will supply a timed HackerRank coding challenge to be completed when applying to internships. It can
  also be used like LeetCode to solve hundreds of technical programming problems.
- [Glassdoor][10] - Glassdoor allows people to post reviews, salaries and most importantly interview questions they've
  received from specific companies.
- [27 Most Common Interview Questions][11] - An interview is a _test_, and here's the testbank.

## Working in the US

Almost every major tech company in the US hires Canadians and will sponsor you for a visa. US companies tend to pay
_significantly_ more and offer great opportunities.

### Visa

You'll need a **J-1** visa to intern in the US. A common misconception is that you can get a visa yourself - this is
not true. You need a company who is willing to sponsor your visa to work in the United States. Once you find this company
they will do most of the work for you, you'll just have to submit some documents/forms. Don't stress about this step.

### Getting Paid

You'll need an American bank account to get paid if you're working in the US. This is very easy to obtain - just go to your
preferred bank once you're in the US and bring your passport and visa documents just in case.

It's also a very good idea to obtain a Social Security Number in the US so that you can apply for a credit card and build up
a credit score in the US (can be helpful in many ways in the future). This is also straight-forward, but you need to wait
until you're in the US for at least 10 days before you can apply.
