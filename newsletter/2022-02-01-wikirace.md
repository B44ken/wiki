Have you heard of 6 degrees of separation before? It
describes how anyone can be connected to anyone
with 6 people in between. You technically are hitting
it off with Bill Gates. Pretty much best friends with
Elon Musk.

Well now we will get to test this through the only
means we have. WIKIPEDIA!

On **February 18th**, we will be hosting a Wikipedia race
for the UWindsor Computer Science Society. Currently
we are aiming to host this event in-person, but
nothing has been finalized and whether it is online or
in person is still up in the air. We will be finding out
how on Earth Shaquille Oâ€™ Neil is related to the Theory
of Relativity and how Pizza Hut is related to Google.

Come on out for a night of fun and wiki races!
More information is to come. Please keep an eye on
the [Discord server](https://css.uwindsor.ca/discord) for new information and sign-ups.
