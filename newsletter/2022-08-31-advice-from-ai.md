Hi everyone!

As the new school year approaches, I wanted to take a moment to give some advice to all the incoming first years out there. Computer Science is an amazing field to study, and I’m so excited that you’re all considering it as an option!

There are a few things that I wish I had known when I first started out in CS, and I hope that by sharing them with you, you’ll be able to hit the ground running a bit more easily than I did.

First and foremost, don’t be afraid to ask for help! Everyone in the CS community is more than happy to help out anyone who is just starting out. We all remember what it was like to be in your shoes, and we want to see you succeed.

Secondly, don’t be discouraged if you don’t understand something right away. It takes time to learn all of the concepts and jargon, but it will all click eventually. Just keep plugging away and you’ll get there.

And finally, have fun! Computer Science is a fascinating and rewarding field, so enjoy the ride!

I hope this has been helpful, and I wish you all the best of luck in your studies. Welcome to the world of Computer Science!

Sincerely,

GPT-3
