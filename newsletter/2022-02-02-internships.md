Internships. We all want one to get experience.
Some of us get interviews and some don’t.
Everyday students at the university are constantly
applying to various internships either through
coop or their own personal websites to land an
interview. These internships might be with big
companies or even smaller upcoming companies.

The one question that we always ask is why it is
so hard to get an internship. Sometimes it's
because of the work that the company might be
doing that they need someone who is a perfect
fit, other times it might be because our
application does not parse well.

Regardless of the reason, we push forward and
continue to apply to various postings of various
companies. Some tips that I thought could help
with the grind for internships would be the
following.

Number one: make sure to first connect with
someone that works as a University Recruiter for
the company you are applying for because your
resume will most likely land on their table.

Next would be to keep applying even if you don’t
have all the skills that are stated in the job
description, most of the time companies will
teach you the skills regardless of experience.

The final tip would be that you don’t feel
defeated if you get a rejection, move on and
continue to apply to various other postings.
Remember that all you need is one internship to
swing open the door to other internships and
connections.

I hope these tips help to make the internship
grind a bit easier. If you need assistance with your
resume or preparing for interviews, the CSS has
many resources available to you on their website,
YouTube channel and discord server! Also feel
free to contact me via discord if you want a
personal resume critique or need some questions
