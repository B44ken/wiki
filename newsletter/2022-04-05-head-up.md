As the semester is zooming past us many of us feel overwhelmed by the number of assignments, midterms and work we all have. Although it may be overwhelming you should make sure that you take time to relax and take care of your mental well-being. Make sure to always take care of yourself and enjoy the time you have at university; it is not all courses and tests. Talk to your friends, do an activity with them, go for a walk outside or play a sport. There are many ways to relax and take a break from the grind of assignments and tests.

If you cannot find any way to de-stress yourself would be to go to The Forge or go for a swim, if you feel overwhelmed and burnt-out talk to someone, that may be a board member or a fellow friend or someone at the University. There are many resources provided to students to ensure that they stay healthy both mentally and physically. To conclude please ensure that you guys are taking care of yourself as school begins to ramp up, if you need to talk to someone, we at CSS are here for you and we can also direct you to the various resources available from the university!
