On Friday, April 8th, the Computer Science Society hosted a CSS Bowling night with 40 attendees. We reserved 7 lanes for people and also ordered 8 large pizzas. This took place at Super Bowl Lanes in Windsor.

The event was a huge success! Every lane was full, everybody had a good time and enjoyed the chance to socialize with the other CS students and representatives. Some participants even got the chance to film material for their campaign.

As restrictions start loosening up more and more, the Computer Science Society is looking forward to hosting more in-person events to allow the students opportunities to hang out and socialize!
