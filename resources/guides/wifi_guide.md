This is a guide to connecting to Wi-Fi on campus.

## Wi-Fi Networks available
When you connect your wireless Wi-Fi device (phone/PC/Mac) to the network, you will see the available wireless networks listed which you can try to connect to. Along with a few others, the primary list will include:
- **eduroam**
- **uwinsecure**
- **uwindsor**

Which should you use? The short answer is “Connect to eduroam”. The eduroam wireless network is available to all wireless users (Students/Faculty/Staff/guests). Plus it has the additional benefit that users from other eduroam institutions (many universities, for example) can also connect to the University of Windsor’s wireless network using their home institution’s crededentials.

## Eduroam - The Preferred Wireless Network

**Eduroam** is a network used by many universities, and your UWindsor sign in will work at any campus that uses eduroam.
1. Open Wi-Fi settings on your device and select the “eduroam” network
2. Depending on your device you will be prompted for different settings. Here is the list of all possibilities. Fill in any you see.
(Most computers will only ask for Username and Password)
- EAP method: PEAP
- Phase 2 authentication: MSCHAPV2
- CA certificate: Use System Certificates (or leave blank if this is not an option)
- **Identity (username): Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca)**
- Anonymous identity: Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca)
- **Password: Your UWinID password**
3. If prompted to trust a certificate after signing in (mainly iPhone) click trust.

Once you initially connect to eduroam, the next time you connect, the saved password will be used automatically to log in. This causes an unfortunate side-effect on most devices when your password changes however. To avoid using the old password, after you change your password you should go to the wireless settings on your device and “forget” the eduroam network. When you reconnect, you should be prompted for the new password which will again be saved until the next time your password changes.

University of Windsor Faculty and Staff can also use the uwinsecure wireless network. Access to printers are available from this network. This network has the same password change idiosyncrasies as eduroam mentioned above.

The uwindsor wireless network is available for use but should only be used as a **last resort**. Unlike eduroam and uwinsecure, the uwindsor network does not encrypt the network traffic. So, for example, if you are accessing network applications using a protocol which is insecure, (eg. http instead of https), then everyone else using the uwindsor network in the vicinity could view your network activity. The wireless network called uwindsor is not secure.

### For Residence Students

While Eduroam is the primary campus-wide Wi-Fi network, you may want to use UWinResLife in your hall for heavier use (i.e. streaming or downloading). Sign in using your UWindsor ID (just the first part - *not @uwindsor.ca*), and your UWinID password.

### Activating Your UWindsor Account

You use your UWindsor ID to sign into your UWinsite Student, Blackboard, MySuccess, etc. Your UWindsor email address is your ID @uwindsor.ca and sign-in is via Gmail.

To activate your ID, you will require your 9-digit Student Number and 4-digit Personal Access Code (PAC). Find these by searching your inbox, or on your acceptance letter. Visit the Leddy Library or the Computer Centre to use an internet-enabled computer and activate your account.

If you are a confirmed student and never used my.uwindsor.ca before, you can activate your UWin Account on this site: my.uwindsor.ca/web/uw/activate-account

### The IT Service Desk

The IT Service Desk is located in the University Computer Centre (south entrance of the CAW building). ITS can help with any UWinID access or password issues, student email issues, and any information as to processes and policies involving University computers and networks on campus. ITS can also be reached at 519-253-3000 x4440 and is open 8:30AM to 4:30PM. Students also have the ability to report an issue or question at www.uwindsor.ca/its anytime.
